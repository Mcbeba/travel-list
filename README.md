## Travel List

A React app that is a simple travel-list where we can add all the items that we need for your next trip. 

This project was created during the course: [The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). The primary purpose of this project is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.
